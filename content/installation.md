# Installation

**Note:** This is the demo content for demonstration purpose only. The primary function of this content is to show you what this theme can do. There is a more detailed explanation in the **Getting Started** section.

### Callouts

---

There are two types of callouts available in this theme, **note** and **important**. To add a callout to your documentation simply add the following `html` code with class `important` or `note`. Like in the example bellow.

#### HTML example

Copy the code and modify these blocks according to your needs.

```html
<div class="important">
  <strong>Important:</strong>
  This is an "Important" callout block of text. This block indicates a warning
  or caution. Use it for an important message.
</div>
```

```html
<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  This is a "Note" callout block of text. This block signifies a general note.
</div>
```

#### Live example

**Important:** This is an "Important" callout block of text. This block indicates a warning or caution. Use it for an important message.**Note:** This is an "Note" callout block of text. This block signifies a general note.

### Code blocks

---

**Note:** Code blocks have copy functionality. To copy the code press the grey button located in the right side top corner.

You can create simple code blocks by placing triple backticks ` ``` ` before and after the code block. To render a code block more readable, we recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks.

````
```
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```
````

```
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```

#### Syntax highlighting

You can add a language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your code block. For example, to syntax highlight **JavaScript** code, specify `javascript` next to the tick marks before the fenced code block:

````
```javascript
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```
````

The rendered output looks like this:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```

### Tables

---

You can build tables with markdown to help you organize information. To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column’s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column like in the example below.

```
| Title | Title |
| ------| ----- |
| Text  | Text  |
| Text  | Text  |
```

| Title | Title |
| ----- | ----- |
| Text  | Text  |
| Text  | Text  |

**Note:** Creating tables with hyphens and pipes can be time-consuming. To speed up the process, try using the [Markdown Tables Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).
